# ANALYSIS OF CONTENT CATEGORIES WITH THE LARGEST POPOLARITY
This repository contains the file for a comprehensive analysis of a social medial and content creation company dataset

## Introduction
This project entails a comprehensive data analysis of social media and content creation datasets. It involved 3 datasets which are Reaction, Content, and Reaction types. The datasets were used to derive insight into an analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”. It entailed using the Python programming language for exploratory data analysis, which included data understanding, data preprocessing, and data merging. SQL was also used to determine the top 5 content categories based on their popularity. However, Power BI was used for data modelling, highlighting insights through the dashboard.

## INSIGHTS
Based on the analysis done, it was revealed that Animal was the most popular content category by their number of total scores. Also, audio and photo content types drive the highest scores. It was also discovered that the highest post was recorded in May.

## CONCLUSION
The report highlights the top 5 categories as Animal, Science, Healthy Eating, Technology, and Food and it shows that the user engagement was basically in the morning, and it recorded the highest volume on Friday and the lowest volume on Saturday. With the above insight, we recommend that effort should be tailored to user engagement in these categories and especially concentrating on Friday morning to fully maximise reach which can in turn boost their revenue. The strategy will not only enhance the revenue but also make the company more appealing to potential investors which aligns with their goal of going public at the end of the year.
The findings also show that audio and photo content have higher scores than video and GIF. Based on these, we recommend that more audio and photo content should be created which could include podcasts and high-quality images. Also, the use of audio and photo content should be used to promote video and GIF content. Optimize audio and photo content for search engines. This includes using relevant keywords in the title, description, and tags of your content.
